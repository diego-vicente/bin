# `bin` - A collection of scripts for everyday use

This repository contains a small collections of tiny scripts I use in my day to day, and even though they are tailor-made they may be useful as inspiration or support when developing your own.

## Install

All the scripts are based on `bash` - but one instance of it is more than likely installed in your machine. Below you can find a (non-comprehensive) list of dependencies for the scripts below.

```shell
brew install gum
```

To use the scripts system-wide, remember to add the path to your local copy of this repository to the `$PATH` environment variable.
